My previous three research projects in paleoclimatology have enabled me to develop a strong fundamental and interdisciplinary background of the field that has enabled me to take charge and develop my own research questions and hypotheses. 

## 2017 
My first research project was in the summer of 2017 with Dr. Rhawn Denniston when I used ICP-OES to examine trace element profiles in stalagmites from northern Australia to assess how well they tracked paleo-hydroclimate. The goal of this research project was to use tropical stalagmites as proxy records of precipitation through their oxygen-18/oxygen-16 isotope ratios (ùõø18O) which have been accurately dated using uranium-thorium methods. Rainwaters in many tropical areas have ùõø18O levels that are driven by the ‚Äúamount effect‚Äù in which higher amounts of rainfall are generally depleted in ùõø18O. Stalagmites incorporate the oxygen from rainwater which means that stalagmite ùõø18O is reflective of rainwater ùõø18O and, thus, the intensity of rainfall through time. The stalagmites were analyzed and relationships between Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, Œ¥18O, and Œ¥13C were examined. By analyzing data from the ICP-OES we found that Mg/Ca ratios tend to be correlated with both Œ¥18O and Œ¥13C. Sr/Ca ratios, on the other hand, do not exhibit a strong relationship with either Œ¥18O or Œ¥13C. Both collective and individual stalagmite data have confirmed these trends. We interpret these findings to suggest that Mg/Ca ratios are more closely linked to past changes in rainfall and vegetation at this site.  This research project lead me to take on a new challenge in paleoclimatology; computer coding. 

## 2018 
In the summers of 2018 and 2019, I performed independent research at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) under Dr. Caroline Ummenhofer as a Guest Student to investigate monsoon rainfall from the same region of northern Australia, analyzing paleoclimate data from stalagmites using XRF, LA-ICP-MS, SIMS, and SEM and modeling using NCAR‚Äôs Community Earth System Model - Last Millennium Ensemble (NCL CESM-LME). The techniques, skills, and breadth of knowledge learned throughout these projects have enabled me to approach this paleoclimate investigation from a new lens. As a Guest Student at WHOI, I learned the modeling language of NCL to investigate the response of Australian summer monsoon precipitation to large volcanic eruptions during the last millennium using the CESM-LME with a particular focus on the large Samalas eruption in 1257 CE. I assessed relative contributions of forcings to rainfall in northern Australia by analyzing precipitation, moisture transport, and sea surface temperature in the years following these eruptions. The synthesis of KNI-51 stalagmites and the LME volcanic forcing ensemble members thus offers a promising opportunity to diagnose and understand the hydroclimatic response to volcanic eruptions. I presented the findings of this research project at the 2018 AGU Fall Meeting. During my second summer at WHOI, I could not only combine my two previous research experiences, but was able to actively contribute to the direction of this third research project. 

## 2019 
While I was reading research papers about how volcanic aerosols impact tropical hydroclimate, I wondered if the stalagmite record would capture these spikes in sulfur. I did some investigation and found that not many scientists have used sulfur to pinpoint the exact location of a volcanic eruption in stalagmites. By using analytical techniques, like SIMS, to identify a sulfur spike in the stalagmites, we will be able to more accurately link the stalagmites to the eruption, thus making the climatic response more visible. While my previous background had focused on computer modeling and using stalagmites as a paleoclimate proxy my knowledge on volcanic eruptions and their complexity was limited to information learned in Igneous Petrology. While at WHOI I pushed myself as an independent researcher while in the lab. As an independent researcher at WHOI I networked with scientists to learn more about volcanic eruptions, tackled the challenge of not only learning a new computer coding language but compared model output to proxy data, and learned several analytical techniques to test my hypothesis if stalagmites were able to record the volcanic signal. I needed to know everything I could about how tropical eruption impacted the tropical hydroclimate, and this curiosity is what has lead me the University of California Santa Barbara.
