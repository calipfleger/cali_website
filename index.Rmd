I am passionate about advocating for sustainable changes along with my research interests in investigating the hydroclimatic response to anthropogenic climate change. At the Bren School, I am pursuing a PhD in Environmental Science and Management and plans to advance my climate modeling research with the goal to continue within academia post-graduation.
